Me learning how to use fancy ML models on a playground dataset.

Hopefully wanna learn gradient boosting.

How to use:
- Run scraper to unzip data into data folder
- If dataset is from a competition, line to download file via command line is in scraper, else download zip manually from link provided
- Save models in model/ to avoid clutter
